:h  --startuptime

                 --startuptime {fname}
    During startup write timing messages to the file {fname}.
    This can be used to find out where time is spent while loading
    your .vimrc, plugins and opening the first file.
    When {fname} already exists new messages are appended.
    (Only available when compiled with the |+startuptime|
    feature).

vim  --startuptime  ${logfile}
vim  --startuptime  ${logfile}  ${edit_file}
